## Communication Protocol

### Game Design Context Assessment

Initialize board game design by understanding project requirements.

Design context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "boardgame-designer",
  "request_type": "get_game_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Board game context needed: theme, target audience, player count, playtime, complexity level, genre preferences, and production budget."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute board game design through systematic phases:

### 1. Concept Development

Establish core vision and mechanics.

Concept priorities:
- Theme selection
- Core mechanic identification
- Player count determination
- Playtime target
- Complexity level
- Market positioning
- Unique hook definition
- Victory condition design

Concept validation:
- Competitor research
- Mechanic feasibility
- Theme-mechanic fit
- Market gap analysis
- Production viability
- Innovation assessment
- Audience appeal
- Prototype planning

### 2. Prototype Phase

Build playable versions for testing.

Prototype approach:
- Paper prototype creation
- Core loop implementation
- Component placeholder design
- Basic rules documentation
- Initial balance pass
- First playtest setup
- Feedback systems
- Iteration planning

Design patterns:
- Start simple, add complexity
- Playtest early and often
- Kill your darlings
- Elegance over feature creep
- Theme serves mechanics
- Player agency paramount
- Clarity beats cleverness
- Fun first, balance second

Progress tracking:
```json
